# Workday-Scheduler-Using-APIs

Created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code, using the Day.js library to work with date and time. 

AS AN employee with a busy schedule, I WANT to add important events to a daily planner, SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.

WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar, THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours, WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future, WHEN I click into a timeblock, THEN I can enter an event, WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist
